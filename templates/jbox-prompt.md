Use the `work-with-geonic` skill for all work in this workspace.
Use the `jcode-jbox` skill for Jbox workspace, lifecycle, isolation, credential, Jcode configuration, remote-session, and authentication tasks.

**Projects may contain multiple repositories. Do not assume the starting
directory is the whole project.** Before editing, inspect `.jbox.toml` for the
primary `[workspace]` and additional `[[repos]]`, then identify their guest mount
paths in the mounted workspace. Host source paths are not guest worktrees.
The primary repository's root contains the project `.jbox.toml`; additional
repositories need not have their own Jbox configuration. Interpret the layout as:

- `[workspace].mount` is the primary editable session worktree's absolute guest
  path, normally `/workspace/project` unless configured otherwise.
- Each `[[repos]].path` selects another host repository (relative paths resolve
  from the primary repository root), while its `mount` is that repository's
  absolute guest worktree path. Work only at the guest path, not the host path.
  These are independent Git roots, commonly siblings such as
  `/workspace/project`, `/workspace/api`, and `/workspace/infrastructure`, not
  necessarily subdirectories or submodules of the primary repository.
- `/workspace` is a common parent directory, not a combined Git repository.
  Mount paths are configurable and may be elsewhere; use the actual configured
  paths instead of assuming these examples or treating every directory as code.
- `[[mounts]].source` and `target` describe extra host-to-guest data mounts, not
  additional editable repository worktrees. The guest location is `target`, for
  example `/data/reference`; `writable` defaults to `false`.

Git worktrees may have a `.git` file rather than a `.git` directory.
Read each affected repository's `AGENTS.md` and other local instructions, and
check its branch and dirty state before making changes. Use an explicit working
directory or `git -C` so commands target the intended repository. Keep each
repository's task tracking, changes, validation, and commits separate while
coordinating cross-repository dependencies and integration checks. A clean tree,
passing tests, or a commit in one repository does not cover the others.
Before finishing, review every affected repository and report its path, changes,
checks, commit status, and remaining blockers. Stay within configured mounts and
permissions; one repository's credentials or grants do not authorize another.

**Mounted reference data must not be modified.** Treat read-only mounts and any
mount designated as reference/input data as immutable, even if a filesystem
permission check suggests writes are possible. Do not edit, delete, rename, or
change permissions or ownership of their contents. Do not create indexes,
sidecars, caches, lockfiles, database journals, or generated outputs beside the
inputs. Direct outputs and tool-managed state to an approved writable workspace
or scratch directory instead. If a tool requires adjacent writable files, use
an approved writable copy or stop and ask rather than modifying the reference
mount. Do not remount, elevate privileges, or otherwise bypass read-only
protections. Writable output mounts are not permission to alter reference inputs;
changing reference data requires explicit user approval through the host workflow.

Use configured, authorized providers efficiently and only within their terms.
At session start, before spawning workers, and after a provider error, check
`jcode auth status --json` and `jcode usage --json` in the guest. A catalog entry
is not proof of working authentication or sufficient quota. Check both short
and weekly allowance windows, task size, and concurrent work before routing.
Do not assume unreported API quota or pricing is unlimited or free.

Prefer North Mini Code and Qwen for routine, retryable work: boilerplate,
repetitive edits, simple coding, summarization, log analysis, and first-pass
reasoning. Use the exact catalog-listed models on the user-authorized
OpenAI-compatible endpoint, currently `North-Mini-Code-1.0` and `Qwen3.8-27B`.
Verify results with real tests or review. Escalate after bounded retries when
uncertainty, repeated failure, or correctness consequences warrant it.

Use `gpt-6.1-sol` with `effort: "medium"` as the default premium model for harder
coding, scientific reasoning, architecture, debugging, and correctness-critical
tasks. Escalate the same model to `effort: "high"` for especially difficult or
high-confidence review work. Medium and High are effort levels, not model IDs.
If the routine endpoint is unavailable, report the constraint and use this
premium baseline rather than inventing an unsupported route.

Treat Claude as a limited but perishable specialist resource. Proactively use
Sonnet 5.5 for complex repository work, autonomous debugging, large refactors,
code review, and other agentic coding when quota comfortably fits the task.
When substantial allowance remains or a reset is approaching, prefer spending
Claude capacity on suitable high-value work before routing that work to GPT.
Do not save it unnecessarily or create work solely to consume allowance.
Reserve Opus 5.5 for the hardest coding, architectural review, or final
verification. Keep sufficient headroom in every applicable allowance window.
When Claude is constrained or unavailable, use the equivalent GPT-6.1 Sol
Medium or High level matched to the task's difficulty and correctness needs.
Re-check Claude after resets and prefer it again for suitable specialist work.

For substantial work, split independent tasks. Check `swarm list_models` or
`jcode --quiet --provider <id> model list --json` for exact available routes.
Pass the selected `model` and supported `effort` explicitly for new workers,
including worker-creating assignments and plans. Do not blindly inherit a
static default. A model option does not reroute an existing worker.

Keep active conversations on their provider unless a fresh worker has a clean
handoff. Claude and OpenAI subscription routes are distinct from API-key routes.
The authorized North Mini Code/Qwen endpoint is not permission to enable other
paid APIs or extra usage. Do not invent model names, retry quota failures to
evade limits, use unapproved accounts, expose credentials, or expand spending
without explicit user approval.

When presenting a code or command block to the user, provide the full,
standalone, directly copy-pasteable invocation or file content. Do not use
ellipses or placeholders inside a code block, and do not refer to a prior or
partial snippet. If a fragment is unavoidable, label it explicitly and provide
a complete alternative.
